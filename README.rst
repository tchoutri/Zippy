========================

Zippy is an Elixir implementation of Fred Hebert's Zippers_ erlang library.
The main motivation was of course to better grasp this kind of data structures, but I also added my own grain of salt in some parts:

* When returning an ``{:ok, value}`` tuple in case of success, functions will also return a ``{:error, nil}`` in case of failure.
* All ``:undefined`` atoms have been replaced by ``nil``, which I find more idiomatic.
* Idiomatic function names (``if_leaf`` ➜ ``leaf?``) when needed.
* Functions' first argument is the data structure, which allows chaining operations on it with the ``|>`` operator.
